          Hi, I&apos;m <strong>Frankie</strong>, the founder of Pelican App Solutions LLC.
          Our mission is simple: create <strong>sleek, smooth, clutter-free</strong> apps that help businesses 
          get the job done without the headache. 
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-center text-gray-700 max-w-2xl mt-4 leading-relaxed">
          Unlike the saturated app market filled with <strong>endless in-app purchases and high fees</strong>, 
          Pelican focuses on <strong>efficiency, simplicity, and affordability</strong>. 
          We believe that technology should work <strong>for you, not against you</strong>.
